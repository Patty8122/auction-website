# 1. Use Semantic Versioning

Date: 2023-11-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a versioning system that can help us keep track of changes in a clear and predictable manner, especially given the iterative nature of our development process.

## Decision

Adopt Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 for the auction service project.
Semantic Versioning uses a three-part version number: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where:
- MAJOR version is incremented when incompatible API changes are made
- MINOR version is incremented when backward-compatible functionality is introduced
- PATCH version is incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes

## Consequences

- Clear version numbering system that indicates when breaking changes have been introduced.
- Easier to track changes and issues across different versions of the service.
